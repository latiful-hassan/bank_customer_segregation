# tableau_table_calculations_advanced_dashboards_and_stories
Created a customer segregation dashboard and used it for a story with insights:
  - created a bank demographics map, gender pie chart, age distribution, balance distribution and job classification tree map to form a dashboard for the creation of a story
  - the bank demographics map shows the count of customers for each region
  - the gender pie chart shows the percentage of male and female customers for the whole bank 
  - the age distributions shows the bank's customers by age which is binned
  - the balance distribution shows the percentage of customers with a certain amount of money as balance which is binned for clarity
  - the job classification tree map succinctly shows the proportion of white collar, blue collar and other workers that form the customer base for the bank
  - finally, a fully interactive dashboard was created with the 5 vizzes and then I developed a story which has some rudimentary insights on the data
